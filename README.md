# Large Scale Machine Learning with Python
This is the code repository for [Large Scale Machine Learning with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/large-scale-machine-learning-python?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785887215), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## Instructions
The execution of the code examples provided in this book requires an installation of Python 2.7 or higher versions on macOS, Linux, or Microsoft Windows.
The examples throughout the book will make frequent use of Python's essential libraries, such as SciPy, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and StatsModels, and to a minor extent, matplotlib and pandas, for scientific and statistical computing. We will also make use of an out-of-core cloud computing application called H2O.
This book is highly dependent on Jupyter and its Notebooks powered by the Python kernel. We will use its most recent version, 4.1, for this book.
The first chapter will provide you with all the step-by-step instructions and some useful tips to set up your Python environment, these core libraries, and all the necessary tools.
